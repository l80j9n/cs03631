Course   Materials
This section describes   the   course materials   that   you will   need   for   CHEM   1505.
Lab   Kit   Lab   Manual
Your lab kit provides equipment,chemicals,and anything else that   you will   need   to   do   the   experiments   and   can't   provide   for   yourself.Some common materials,like vinegar and other   household   items,you   may   need   to   supply.
Your Lab Manual   (found on Lab Manual tab)gives you instructions on   how   to   do   each   experiment.These   instructions   have   been   tested 代 写CHEM 1505: Chemistry Laboratory I
代做程序编程语言by lab instructors and students,but   if   you have   any   questions   about   a   procedure   or   something   doesn't   work,contact   your   Open Learning   Faculty   Member.
You will be instructed to keep observations in   laboratory notes.You   will   not   send   all   of   your   notes   for   grading,but   you   will   be   asked to send certain data tables,answers to   questions,and photos   showing   techniques   or   results.You will   need   to   have   access   to a digital camera during the experiments to   take   photos   of   your   progress.Make   sure   that   you   keep   very   detailed,neat,well   organized notes so that you can show   that you   have   done   the   experiment   and   have   understood   the   concepts.Your   laboratory   notes will help you prepare   for   your   labreports   and   the   final   exam.
